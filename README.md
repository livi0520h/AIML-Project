# AIML-Project
This project implements an autonomous delivery agent that navigates 2D grid maps using multiple planners.
It contains:
- src/: source code for planners and a CLI demonstration
- maps/: generated maps in text format (0 = obstacle, >=1 = movement cost)
- output/: experimental results, logs and plots
- A short project skeleton report (report_skeleton.md)
